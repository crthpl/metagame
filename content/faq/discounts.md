question: "Do you offer any discounts?"
---

Yes, we offer several discount options:

- **Early Bird**: We have tiered pricing that increases over time. I once tried to do <a href="https://bayesshammai.substack.com/i/147141321/weird-experimental-pricing-scheme" target="_blank"> an exponential pricing system</a> based on what number ticket you purchased and it was a huge mess. So this one just has date cutoffs.

- **NPC (Volunteer ticket)**: Volunteers work 6 shifts over the weekend in exchange for a substantially reduced ticket price. They help staff the front desk, run the Megagame, make sure sessions are going smoothly, and do various other tasks that need to be done.

- **Hidden discounts**: There are plenty of easter eggs throughout the site that will unlock discounts. Each discount code will only be available a limited number of times.

- **Community Partner Discount**: If you want to be a major sponsor, we'll give you a free ticket, for a confusing notion of "free".
