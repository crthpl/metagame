              We will provide the venue, the resources, and the very eager
              audience, and you can run whatever experimental game concept
              you&apos;ve been toying with.

              Need a weirdly shaped space to build a gradient descent themed
              escape room? Want to run a game design tournament where you
              provide the board and pieces and contestants come up with the
              rules? Looking for hundreds of willing subjects for a social
              deception experiment that isn&apos;t quite ready for prime time?
              <br />
              <br />
              Metagame is the conference for you.
