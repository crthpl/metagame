    question: 'Do you offer any discounts?',
    contentHtml: (
      <>
        <p>Yes, we offer several discount options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Volunteer tickets</strong>: Applications for volunteer
            tickets can be found{' '}
            <a href={URLS.TICKET_VOLUNTEER} target="_blank">
              here
            </a>{' '}
            and will be evaluated on a rolling basis. Volunteers work up to 6
            credits (with most 4-hour shifts worth between 1 and 3 credits)
            during or in advance of the conference, in exchange for a free or
            reduced price ticket.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial aid tickets</strong>: We have a scholarship fund
            with free and reduced price tickets available for people for whom
            attending Metagame would pose a financial hardship. If the current
            ticket price ($580) is prohibitive but a 50% off ticket would be
            doable, you can use the discount code <strong>HALFPRICE</strong> to
            get a $290 ticket, on the honor system. For a reduction in ticket
            price beyond that or to apply for travel assistance, please fill out{' '}
            <a href={URLS.TICKET_FINANCIAL_AID} target="_blank">
              this form
            </a>
            . The deadline to apply for financial aid is Monday, August 25th. We
            will try to get answers by Monday, September 1st.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hidden discounts</strong>: There are plenty of easter eggs
            throughout the site that will unlock discounts. Only one discount
            code can be used per ticket, and the maximum discount attainable
            through minigames and puzzles is $100.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community Partner Discount</strong>
            {`: If you want to be a major sponsor, we'll give you a free ticket, for a confusing notion of "free".`}
          </li>
        </ul>
